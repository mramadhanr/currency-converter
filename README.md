# Currency Converter

This is a currency converter app built with React and Next Js

# Code Structure

I use atomic design pattern for this project for scalability purpose, by splitting component to atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages, i could organise the component and make it reusable. i also add `hoc/` directory for storing all Higher Order Component there.
